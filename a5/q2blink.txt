At the end of the episode the Weeping Angels are in a deadlock. No progress can be made because the angels are looking at each other. This type of deadlock is called an Syncronization deadlock, which results in a failure in cooperation.
Each of the waiting angel is waiting for another angel to block the other. 
The deadlock can be explained as follows : 
The angels cannot move as long as someone is seeing them.

There are 4 angels - Angels 1,2,3 and 4
1 is seeing 2
2 is seeing 1
3 is seeing 1,2,4
4 is seeing 1,2,3

3 cannot make progress untill 4 is seeing it.
4 cannot make progress untill 3 is seeing it.

1 cannot make progress untill 2,3,4 are watching it
2 cannot make progess untill 1,2,4 are seeing it.

So, the dependence of 1 is 1->2->1 and 1->2->3->4->3 and so on
Dependence of 3 is 3->4->3  (thus deadlock) 

To end the deadlock, one of (1,2) and one of (3,4) must be terminated.
